# Meemki

*CP850 cmd game*



## Current State

Currently, *Meemki* is in a very early development state. The main focus is on building the necessary basic functionality (game engine) at the moment.

Already implemented:

* Keyboard input
* EASCII animations of controllable entities
* Drawing the screen/animations

More specific but non-technical:

* There's an intro/loading screen
* An absolut basic level environment is loaded
* Meemki can
  * run left/right
  * jump left/right

## Upcoming

* *Sound Engine*

  [WIP]

* *Level Loading*

  [from File(s)]

* *Screen Paging* or *Continues Scrolling*

  [most likely scrolling is not possible due to performance issues while redrawing the screen]

## Concept/Vision

*Meemki* is a jump'n'run, puzzle and - to a certain degree - educational 2D game which fully runs in a cmd window by using exclusively using [CP850](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/cc195064(v=msdn.10)) (MS-DOS Latin 1) chars for the graphics.

### Plot

> *Meemki*, a somewhat bored security researcher who accidentally exploits and therefore shuts down a part of the *stable universe computer*, is the protagonist in an urban noir-style EASCII game. He learned a lot about the infrastructure he discovered by using an unknown proprietary protocol. Now he knows the universe will de-stabilize reaching an undefined state in a couple of days. He needs to get physical access to the universe computing infrastructure which is held by the *SAOTU (Secret Alliance of the Universe)*. On his way he needs to exploit all kinds of security systems, physical as well as computer based and gets himself in situations he was not prepared for...

### Technical Requirements/Limits

- the whole game graphics will only consist of CP850 chars within a standard cmd window
- only system libs/frameworks will be used

### Style

The visual style of *Meemki* is best described as ***EASCII technoid neon noir***.
